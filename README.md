# Lamport Signature Demo

This is a teeny tiny python script that demonstrates how lamport signatures work. It has no dependencies other than the python standard library. The idea is that you should run the program and go read the source code to understand what is going on. It is written to be easy to read and understand, rather than be a production signing library.

To run, just do `python3 main.py` and it'll go from there. Take a look and enjoy!
